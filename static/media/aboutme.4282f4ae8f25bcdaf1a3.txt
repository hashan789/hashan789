I am a passionate web developer and a recent graduate from University of Kelaniya, 
holding a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science.

With a strong foundation in full-stack web development, 
I specialize in modern technologies including React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB.

I’ve completed a 1-year internship, where I gained hands-on experience building responsive, 
scalable web applications using the full MERN stack. 

This experience strengthened my skills in building dynamic user interfaces, RESTful APIs, and 
working with real-world databases and deployment environments.

#I’m enthusiastic about creating seamless digital experiences and 
continuously exploring new technologies to push the boundaries of what I can build
